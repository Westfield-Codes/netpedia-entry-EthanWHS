  <h2>What's Google Chrome?</h2>
  <p>Google Chrome is a web browser that was developed by <strong>Google</strong>, and released in 2008 for the Windows XP and newer. Google Chrome has evolved throughout the years, in 2009 a beta was released to support the platforms macOS and Linux (officially supported on May 25th, 2010). In February of 2012 Chrome launched a beta for Andriod devices, and it has since become the default browser. Shortly after this Google Chrome was introduced to IOS in June of 2012. </p>
  <h3>Chrome's History</h3>
  <p>The former CEO, Eric Schmidt, opposed the idea of Google creating an independent web browser for six years! He changed his mind after the co-founders of Google (<em>Larry Page and Sergey Brin</em>), developed a demonstration of Chrome with the help of Mozilla Firefox developers. <p>
  <p> In September of 2004, rumors started spreading about Google making its very own web browser. This stemmed from the idea that Google was hiring former Microsoft developers. These rumors turned out to be true, because four years later Google Chrome was officially released to the public in September of 2008.
